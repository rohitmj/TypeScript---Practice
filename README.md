# TypeScript Practice

This repository contains my practice code as I learn **TypeScript** from two main sources:
1. [learn-ts.org](https://www.learn-ts.org) — for structured, interactive lessons covering TypeScript basics to advanced concepts.
2. **Guided ChatGPT practice sessions** — where I work through coding challenges, Vervoe-style test prep, and problem-solving exercises together with ChatGPT.

The goal is to combine formal learning with real-time guided practice to build confidence and fluency in writing TypeScript for real-world applications.

## Learning Goals
- Build a solid understanding of TypeScript fundamentals and advanced topics.
- Apply concepts to solve coding challenges.
- Prepare for **Vervoe-style assessments** for graduate roles, including at Luxury Escapes.
- Strengthen backend development skills and readiness for technical interviews.

---

## Practice Topics Covered
- Variables, types, and interfaces (`type` vs `let`)
- Arrays, loops, and string manipulation
- Higher-order methods (`filter`, `map`, `sort`, `includes`)
- Conditional checks, logical operators
- Object and array transformations
- Problem-solving using **LeetCode-style** and **Vervoe-style** challenges

---

## Notable Problems Solved
- Return even/odd numbers from an array
- Filter words by length and vowels
- Find the longest word in an array
- Reverse a string or reverse words in a sentence
- Count vowels and words starting with vowels
- Process people objects (filter, map, sort)
- Get unique sorted numbers
- **Two Sum problem** (brute force & hashmap solutions)
- Combining multiple filters and transformations
