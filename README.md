# TypeScript Practice

This repository contains my practice code as I learn TypeScript from [learn-ts.org](https://www.learn-ts.org/en/Welcome).  
The website provides interactive lessons and exercises covering both basic and advanced TypeScript concepts, and it’s been a great way to build a solid understanding of the language.

I’m currently working through all the sections on the site and applying what I learn here in this repository.  
This is part of my journey to strengthen my backend development skills, especially using TypeScript in real-world projects.
